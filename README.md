# Monorepo Template

Welcome to the Monorepo Template! This repository is a starting point for creating a monorepo project that houses multiple packages or applications within a single repository.

# Overview
A monorepo, short for "monolithic repository," is a version control concept where multiple projects or packages are stored in a single repository. This approach can simplify development, testing, and deployment processes, especially when these projects or packages are closely related.
